In other words, \"LETS IMPERSONATE DEATH, that way we will never die!\" This is what Toni Morrison so eloquently describes, \"We were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good, but well behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life. We substituted good grammar for intellect; we switched habits to simulate maturity; we rearranged lies and called it truth.\" - The Bluest Eye Chasing after death just to call ourselves brave: the thought process of mental slaves.

Everyone fears the grave, death, 'Sheol'. So their idea was to bring together enough people to somehow feel a 'defiance' against the inevitable. The problem with this wisdom is that it doesn't work. When we die, we all die individually and no one 'with' you can take away the cold hard reality of inevitability.

We don't even know how she got a seat in the high area of the city (operating in the shadows with no accountability).

Just as there are deep foundational things that only you can do, in the same sense the face of your brand, the face of your ministry your business your family can only be done by you, you must provide the finishing touches. Do the GRACE WORK of presentation and presence. \n\nvs. 3 She sends her delegation forth. The truth is even wisdom cannot do everything.  There are some things that you must allow to be done by others in your group because when we work together we work better. Do the GROUP WORK of delegation and delivery. \n\nThe power behind these three verses is that wisdom new what and when to do what she had to do. There are times when we can only do the Grunt work and it's hard and dirty work. Yet there are times that we must learn to 'calibrate' and do Grace work; finishing touches  on things that don't take as much behind-the-scenes work but they do take every bit of our 'presence' and then there are times that we must learn to give over what would doing to the capacity of others to get the job done.

You'll ALWAYS have something to give from your 'tree' of life. So your random acts, are really about as 'random as a hurricane.

The ability to stop, start, and stay. In other words discipline is impulse control.\nSo Solomon is saying in order to learn you must love to control your impulses. This means having a critical look at your self and seeing the areas that you must tighten up and if you cannot do that, Solomon says you are stupid. What is stupid? Stupid is an old word that literally means stunted adamant or the inability to move forward step by step.

Here we get a promise that if you are wise (aka fearing God, living out truth daily, growing and disciplined by lady wisdom) you can trust whats in your heart because wisdom resides there. This means listening deeply to your heart and of course judging it by the word. But the good news is that the right answer isn't too far away (the word is near you, in your mouth)                                                                                     \nBut a fool can't trust or rely on what's in her heart because foolishness will always lead her astray. This means that if you are NOT fearing or respecting God and his boundaries in your life, your own inner compass will ultimately lead you astray. \nSo the real question to keep asking yourself is \"Am I walking in the truth that has been revealed to me or am I resisting truth? Your heart will help you if you're right; but it'll hurt you in the end if you're living foul.",

Did God possibly allow them entry into the earth and particularly our lives as an OPPORTUNITY to display mercy and compassion? Could God come to us in the form of the needy?

If you take a chance and perhaps run into the 'lion' you still have a chance to confront it, tame it, vanquish it, control it. But you'll never know if you don't try.This verse amazes me because I see people everyday who've built up excuses as to why they don't try to advance in life and they won't even challenge the rationale! It's one thing to be physically trapped, but capable people can be 'mentally trapped' away from their blessings because they can't get over the dread of negative possibilities. In the movie Love Jones Larenz Tate alludes to romance as the exploration of possibilities (If I say or do this' then I might get 'this' response etc.) in a sense this is envisioned motivation: where you can play out a scenario in your mind and be motivated by envisioning the outcome. In a similar way, the lazy person builds up mental blocks that stop his/her motivation to even try...in fact they're motivated to NOT TRY!\"A lion is in the streets!\" They already know that they'll fail and therefore relinquish their chances before they engage. On the other hand a prudent person says, \"There's a lion in the streets so I have to be fully prepared for whatever comes because I can't sit here and die!\" A hungry person just says, \"There's FOOD out there in the streets and I gotta do what I gotta do to eat!",
